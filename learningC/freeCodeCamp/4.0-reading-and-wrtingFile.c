/* Yes, the provided excerpt now correctly demonstrates the use of a single
pointer for both writing to and reading from a file. The sequence is as
follows:
1. Write to the file: The fprintf function is used to write to the file
pointed to by pNewFi1e .
2. Close the file: The file is then closed using fclose(pNewFi1e) . This is
important to ensure that all data is flushed to the file and the file is
properly closed before attempting to reopen it.
3. Reopen the file for reading: The file is reopened for reading with
fopen("abid .txt", "r") and the result is assigned back to
pNewF ile . This step is crucial as it resets the file pointer for reading.
4. Read from the file: fgets is used to read from the file into the buffer
line .
5. Print the read content The content read into line is printed to the
standard output using printf .
6. Close the file again: Finally, the file is closed with fclose(pNewFi1e)
after reading.
This sequence ensures that the file is properly handled for both writing and
reading using a single FILE* pointer, with the file being closed and then
reopened between these operations. */
